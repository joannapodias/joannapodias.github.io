"Φως is an improvisational digital-analog hybrid performance piece using a photosensitive analog synthesizer (that I built myself) in conjunction with vocals, DMX-powered string lights, and real time digital effects processing in Max/MSP. The piece aims to unite light and sound, and is best conceived in a dark room over a 5 to 10 minute duration.  

This piece was selected for performance at the 2018 BEAMS Marathon Festival at Brandeis University."

Plz give Booger a snausage in my honor. 

Thanks!

Blehhhhh I forgot to edit the blurb, here:
